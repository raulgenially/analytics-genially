  - name: sharded_date_range
    description: Returns the build statement to restrict a sharded table between a start and an end date.
      The start date is specified as an argument while the end date
      is set to current_date() - 1 day. This is to ensure the source table has complete
      data on that day. By default, start date is ignored on dev environments and is set
      to current_date() - limit_days_on_dev.
    arguments:
      - name: start_date
        type: string (Format YYYY-MM-DD)
        description: The start date of the range. Ignored on dev environments if limit_data_on_dev is True.

      - name: limit_data_on_dev
        type: boolean (Default True)
        description: Whether to limit the date range on dev environments.

      - name: limit_days_on_dev
        type: string (Default 3)
        description: The number of days of data to consider on dev environments.

macros:
  - name: generate_schema_name
    description: Override the core dbt macro `generate_schema_name` to use an alternative pattern for generating
      schema names. With the new pattern, in development environments, all tables are created under the same dataset.
      In production, the tables will be created in the specified dataset (if provided through a schema config parameter)
      or the default target dataset.

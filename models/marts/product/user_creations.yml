  - name: user_creations
    description: >
      This model describes if a user has the possibility to interact with a particular genially for the first time.
      This can be due to different reasons:
      1 - The user has created a new genially following the /create flow.
      2 - The user has received a copy of another genially.
      3 - A collaboration has shared with the user for the first time.
      This data is modeled in such a manner that there is only one record per user per day;
      therefore, it tells you neither the reason nor how many times
      the user has the possibility to interact with a new genially on a certain day.
    columns:
      - name: creation_id
        description: Primary key of this model.
          It is a surrogate key composed by user_id and date(creation_at).
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

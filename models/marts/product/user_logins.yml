      This model describes if a user logs into the App (app.genial.ly).
      This data is modeled in such a manner that there is only one record per user per day;
      therefore, it doesn't tell you how many times the user logs into the App on a certain day.
    columns:
      - name: login_id
        description: Primary key of this model.
          It is a surrogate key composed by user_id and date(login_at).
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: user_id
        description: The user id who logs into the App.

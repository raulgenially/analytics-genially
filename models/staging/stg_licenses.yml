            either Pending, Active, Canceled, Passive Churn or Proactive Churn.

            **Pending** -> the license is created but has not been paid for yet.
            **Active** -> the license has been paid and it is active.
            **Canceled** -> the license is active but the user has canceled the license
                (it will be a proactive churn in the following billing period).
            **Passive Churn** -> the license reached the EOL (end of life) because the
                customer didn't pay the subscription without canceling previously.
            **Proactive Churn** -> the license reached the EOL because the user canceled
                the subscription at some point before the next billing period.

      description: Model describing the activity based on logins.
        A user is considered to be active whether they log in to Genially within a specific interval of time.
        Depending on how long the interval is considered, we can distinguish among,
          Daily active users, activity based on a single day.
          Weekly active users, activity based on the last 7 days.
          Monthly active users, activity based on the last 28 days.
        In turn we can differentiate among different types of user,
          A New user is a user who is in their first interval of using the product.
          A Current user is a user who used the product in the previous interval and the current interval.
          A Churned user is a user who were once actively using the product and then became inactive.
        Thus, active users = new users + current users.
